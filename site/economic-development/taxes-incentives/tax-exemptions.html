	<h2><a id="Franchise Tax Exemptions &amp; Credits" name="Franchise Tax Exemptions &amp; Credits"></a>Franchise Tax Exemptions &amp; Credits</h2>

<h4>Solar Energy Franchise Tax Exemption</h4>

<p>A corporation in Texas engaged solely in the business of manufacturing, selling, or installing solar energy devices is exempted from the franchise tax. There is no ceiling on this exemption provided by <a href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/TX/htm/TX.171.htm#171.056" target="_blank">Section 171.056 of Texas Tax Code</a>, so it is a substantial incentive for solar manufacturers.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this exemption, a solar energy device means &quot;a system or series of mechanisms designed primarily to provide heating or cooling or to produce electrical or mechanical power by collecting and transferring solar-generated energy. The term includes a mechanical or chemical device that has the ability to store solar-generated energy for use in heating or cooling or in the production of power.&quot;</p>

<h4>Refund for Job Creation in an Enterprise Zone</h4>

<p>Taxpayers located in an enterprise zone that create at least 10 new permanent jobs can qualify for <a href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/TX/htm/TX.171.htm#171.501" target="_blank">a franchise tax refund</a>. <a href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/GV/htm/GV.2303.htm#2303.402" target="_blank">Qualifying firms</a> must be certified by the Texas Economic Development Bank. The refund is the lesser of $5,000 or 25% of the amount of franchise tax due for the period.</p>

<h4>Research &amp; Development Tax Credit</h4>

<p>Companies engaged in qualified research activities (as defined under federal tax law) in Texas may choose between accepting a <a href="https://www.comptroller.texas.gov/taxes/qualified-research/" target="_blank">sales tax exemption or a franchise tax credit</a> for materials, software and equipment used for R&amp;D purposes.</p>

<p>The credit available is 5% of the difference between: (1) qualified research expenses incurred during the period on which the reporting period and (2) 50% of the average amount of qualified research expenses incurred during the three tax periods preceding the period on which the report is based. If the taxable entity has no qualified research expenses in one or more of the three tax periods preceding the period on which the report is based, the credit for the period on which the report is based equals 2.5% of the qualified research expenses incurred during that period.</p>

<p>An additional franchise tax credit would be available to companies that partnered on research projects with universities and private higher education institutions. In this case, the credit available is 6.25% of the difference between: (1) qualified research expenses incurred during the period on which the reporting period and (2) 50% of the average amount of qualified research expenses incurred during the three tax periods preceding the period on which the report is based. If the taxable entity has no qualified research expenses in one or more of the three tax periods preceding the period on which the report is based, the credit for the period on which the report is based equals 3.125% of the qualified research expenses incurred during that period.</p>

<p>Unused credits may be carried forward.</p>

<h4>Relocation Expenses Deduction</h4>

<p>Companies <a href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/TX/htm/TX.171.htm#171.109" target="_blank">may deduct from apportioned margin relocation costs</a> incurred in relocating their main office or other principal place of business to Texas from another state provided the company (1)&nbsp;did not do business in Texas before the relocation and (2)&nbsp;is not a member of an affiliated group engaged in a unitary business, another member of which is already doing business in Texas.</p>

<p>Deductible relocation costs include (1)&nbsp;costs of relocating computers and peripherals, other business supplies, furniture, and inventory; and (2)&nbsp;any other costs related to the relocation that are allowable deductions for federal income tax purposes. The deduction must be taken on the company&rsquo;s initial franchise tax filing.</p>

<h4>Renewable Energy Device Deductions</h4>

<p>A taxable entity may deduct from its apportioned margin 10% of the amortized cost of a solar energy device. Under <a href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/TX/htm/TX.171.htm#171.107" target="_blank">the statute</a>&rsquo;s definition, wind energy is also included as an eligible technology. A similar deduction is available for equipment associated with a <a href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/TX/htm/TX.171.htm#171.108" target="_blank">clean coal project</a>.</p>

<h4>Tax Credit for Rehabilitation of Historic Structures</h4>

<p>A tax credit of 25% of the total eligible costs and expenses incurred in the <a href="https://comptroller.texas.gov/taxes/historic-structures/" target="_blank">certified rehabilitation of the certified historic structure</a> can be applied to a taxpayer&rsquo;s franchise tax due. The tax payer must have an ownership interest in the certified historic structure in the year during which the structure is placed in service after the rehabilitation. Eligible structures are Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks, listed in the National Register of Historic Places, or located in specified historic districts. Eligible costs and expenses are defined by the Internal Revenue Code. Carryforward is available and credits can be sold or assigned.</p>

	<h2><a id="Property Tax Abatements &amp; Exemptions" name="Property Tax Abatements &amp; Exemptions"></a>Property Tax Abatements &amp; Exemptions</h2>

<h4>Value Limitation &amp; Tax Credits</h4>

<p>The Texas Economic Development Act, <a href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/TX/htm/TX.313.htm" target="_blank">Tax Code Chapter 313</a>, is intended to encourage large-scale manufacturing, research and development, and other investment projects to the State of Texas. It requires companies to invest a specified amount of money to qualify for an 8-year reduction in property taxes (as long as the local school district elects to participate). The qualifying investment amount is determined on a sliding scale that begins at $100 million for large urban areas and is reduced for areas with a lower tax base.</p>

<p>An appraised value limitation is an agreement in which a taxpayer agrees to build or install property and create jobs in exchange for an 8-year limitation on the taxable property value for school district maintenance and operations tax (M&amp;O) purposes and a tax credit.</p>

<p>To qualify, the property must be in a reinvestment zone or enterprise zone and must be devoted to manufacturing, research and development, a clean coal project, an advanced clean energy project, renewable energy electric generation, electric power generation using integrated gasification combined cycle technology, nuclear electric power generation, or a computer center used primarily in connection to one of the other categories.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.comptroller.texas.gov/economy/local/ch313/index.php" target="_blank">Additional information on this incentive</a> is provided by the Comptroller of Public Accounts.</p>

<h4>Property Tax Abatement Agreements</h4>

<p>A <a href="https://www.comptroller.texas.gov/economy/local/ch312/index.php" target="_blank">property tax abatement</a> is a local agreement between a taxpayer and a taxing unit that exempts all or part of the increase in the value of the real property and/or tangible personal property from taxation for a period not to exceed 10 years. Tax abatements are an economic development tool available to cities, counties and special districts to attract new industries and to encourage the retention and development of existing businesses through property tax exemptions or reductions. School districts may not enter into abatement agreements. The statutes governing tax abatements are located in <a href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/TX/htm/TX.312.htm" target="_blank">Texas Tax Code Chapter 312</a>. Each taxing unit that wants to consider tax abatement proposals must designate a reinvestment zone or an enterprise zone.</p>

<h4>Chapter 380/381 Financing</h4>

<p>Chapters <a href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/LG/htm/LG.380.htm" target="_blank">380</a> and <a href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/LG/htm/LG.381.htm" target="_blank">381</a> of the Local Government Code provide legislative authority for Texas municipalities and counties to provide a <a href="https://www.comptroller.texas.gov/economy/local/ch380-381/index.php" target="_blank">grant or a loan of city or county funds or services</a> in order to promote economic development. Local governments have utilized the provisions under this law to provide a wide array of incentives that have drawn businesses and industries to locales throughout Texas. Whether a local government provides any such incentive is completely discretionary. A city or county may provide a Chapter 380 or 381 grant in the form of a sales or property tax rebate.</p>

<h4>Reinvestment Zones</h4>

<p>The designation of specified areas as &quot;reinvestment zones&quot; is a local economic development tool used by municipalities and counties throughout the state of Texas. Reinvestment zones have been used to stimulate local economies by attracting new companies and encouraging the growth of existing businesses. These zones can be created for the purpose of granting local businesses ad valorem property tax abatements on a portion of the value of real and/or tangible personal property located in the zone, for a period of up to 10 years.</p>

<p>Special taxation entities having jurisdiction over a reinvestment zone may participate in executed abatement agreements; however, the special taxing districts may not designate reinvestment zones or initiate tax abatement agreements. Reinvestment zones are designated by local ordinance or resolution. Incorporated cities, counties and special districts are allowed to enter into tax abatement agreements. However, school districts no longer possess this ability.</p>

<p>The Comptroller of Public Accounts has responsibility for the state&#39;s central registry of reinvestment zones for tax abatements and tax increment financing. The 2016 <a href="https://www.comptroller.texas.gov/economy/local/ch311/biennial-reports.php" target="_blank">biennial report</a> indicates active reinvestment zones in six communities in three area counties (Austin, Georgetown, Kyle, Leander, Pflugerville and Taylor).</p>

<h4>Freeport Exemption</h4>

<p>A community may choose to offer the <a href="https://www.comptroller.texas.gov/economy/local/transit-exemptions/index.php" target="_blank">freeport exemption</a> for various types of goods that are detained in Texas for a short period of time. Freeport property includes goods, wares, merchandise, ores, and certain aircraft and aircraft parts. Freeport property qualifies for an exemption from ad valorem taxation only if it has been detained in the state for 175 days or less for the purpose of assembly, storage, manufacturing, processing, or fabricating.&nbsp; For certain aircraft parts, a community, by official action, may extend the deadline to 730 days. Freeport exemptions in the Austin area are noted in the &ldquo;Local Incentive Programs&rdquo; section below. A <a href="../../upload/files/ed/FreeportMap.pdf" target="_blank">freeport exemptions map</a> is also located on the Chamber&rsquo;s website.</p>

<h4>Pollution Control Equipment</h4>

<p>A Texas constitutional amendment providing an exemption from property taxation for pollution control equipment was approved in 1993. The intent was to ensure that compliance with environmental mandates through capital investments did not result in an increase in a facility&#39;s property taxes. A facility must first receive a determination from the <a href="https://www.tceq.texas.gov/airquality/taxrelief" target="_blank">Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ)</a> that property is for pollution control purposes. That positive use determination is then provided to the local appraisal district, which must accept the TCEQ&#39;s decision and grant the property an exemption from property taxes.</p>

<p>To be eligible for a positive use determination, the property must have been purchased, acquired, constructed, installed, replaced, or reconstructed after January 1,1994 to meet or exceed federal, state, or local environmental laws, rules, or regulations.</p>

<h4>Solar or Wind-Powered Energy Devices</h4>

<p>The Texas property tax code allows an exemption of the amount of the appraised property value that arises from the installation or construction of a solar or wind-powered energy device that is primarily for the production and distribution of thermal, mechanical, or electrical energy for on-site use, or devices used to store that energy. The Texas Comptroller publishes <a href="https://www.comptroller.texas.gov/taxes/property-tax/docs/96-1569.pdf" target="_blank">guidelines for the solar and wind-powered energy device exemption</a>.</p>

	<h2><a id="Sales &amp; Use Tax Exemptions" name="Sales &amp; Use Tax Exemptions"></a>Sales &amp; Use Tax Exemptions</h2>

<h4>Manufacturing Machinery &amp; Equipment</h4>

<p>Leased or purchased machinery, equipment, replacement parts, and accessories that have a useful life of more than six months, and that are used or consumed in the manufacturing, processing, fabricating, or repairing of tangible personal property for ultimate sale, are <a href="https://www.comptroller.texas.gov/taxes/publications/94-124.php" target="_blank">exempt from state and local sales and use tax</a>. Tangible personal property that becomes an ingredient or component of an item manufactured for sale, as well as taxable services performed on a manufactured product to make it marketable are exempt. The exemption also applies to tangible personal property that makes a chemical or physical change in the product being manufactured and is necessary and essential in the manufacturing process, as well as semiconductor fabrication and pharmaceutical biotechnology cleanrooms and equipment. Texas businesses are exempt from paying state sales and use tax on labor for constructing new facilities.</p>

<h4>Natural Gas &amp; Electricity</h4>

<p>Texas companies are exempt from paying state sales and use tax on<a href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/TX/htm/TX.151.htm#151.317" target="_blank"> electricity and natural gas used in manufacturing</a>, processing, or fabricating tangible personal property. The company must complete a &quot;predominant use study&quot; that shows that at least 50% of the electricity or natural gas consumed by the business directly causes a physical change to a product.</p>

<p>Gas and electricity are also exempted from state sales and use taxes if used in the processing, storage, and distribution of data by a qualified data center (a facility certified by the Comptroller as a qualifying data center under <a href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/TX/htm/TX.151.htm#151.359" target="_blank">Section 151.359</a>).</p>

<h4>Construction Labor</h4>

<p>Construction labor is not taxable for new construction projects (building new structures and completing unfinished structures). In addition, the labor to increase the production capacity of a manufacturing or processing production unit in a petrochemical refinery or chemical plant is not taxable.</p>

<h4>Food &amp; Over-the-Counter Drugs &amp; Medicines</h4>

<p>Food products (such as flour, sugar, bread, milk, eggs, fruits, vegetables and similar groceries) and over-the-counter drugs and medicines that are required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to be labeled with a Drug Facts panel, as well as prescription drugs, are not taxable.</p>

<h4>Data Centers</h4>

<p>Tangible property necessary to operate a data center is <a href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/TX/htm/TX.151.htm#151.359" target="_blank">exempt from state sales and use taxes</a> provided the data center meets certain criteria. The single-occupant Texas data center must be at least 100,000 square feet, specifically built or refurbished to house servers and data processing and storage equipment, not be used primarily for delivery of telecommunications services, and have an uninterruptable power source, backup generator, and advanced security and safety technology.</p>

<p>The data center would have to create at least 20 permanent jobs, not including jobs transferred from within the state, with a salary 120% or higher than the average salary in the county in which the data center was built. The data center owner would have to make or agree to make a capital investment of at least $150 million in the data center over a 5-year period. The exemption would expire 10 years after the date of the first exemption for an operator that invested more than $150 million and less than $200 million, and 15 years if the operator invested more than $200 million.</p>

<p>Large data center projects, those comprising at least 250,000 square feet of space, creating at least 40 new full-time jobs paying at least 120% of the average county wage, and entailing a capital investment of at least $500 million in the project over a 5-year period are eligible for a 20-year state <u>and local</u> tax exemption.</p>

<p>A data center is not eligible for these sales tax exemptions if the data center has entered into a <a href="https://www.comptroller.texas.gov/economy/local/ch313/index.php" target="_blank">Chapter 313 agreement</a> limiting the appraised value of the data center&#39;s property.</p>

<h4>Research &amp; Development</h4>

<p>Beginning January 2014, companies engaged in qualified research activities (as defined under federal tax law) in Texas may choose between accepting a <a href="https://www.comptroller.texas.gov/taxes/qualified-research/" target="_blank">sales tax exemption or a franchise tax credit</a> for materials, software and equipment used for R&amp;D purposes. The sales tax exemption can be applied to the sale, storage, or use of depreciable tangible personal property directly used in qualified research.</p>

<h4>Chapter 380/381 Financing</h4>

<p>Chapters <a href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/LG/htm/LG.380.htm" target="_blank">380</a> and <a href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/LG/htm/LG.381.htm" target="_blank">381</a> of the Local Government Code provide legislative authority for Texas municipalities and counties to provide <a href="https://www.comptroller.texas.gov/economy/local/ch380-381/index.php" target="_blank">a grant or a loan of city or county funds or services</a> in order to promote economic development. Local governments have utilized the provisions under this law to provide a wide array of incentives that have drawn businesses and industries to locales throughout Texas. Whether a local government provides any such incentive is completely discretionary. A city or county may provide a Chapter 380 or 381 grant in the form of a sales or property tax rebate.</p>

<h4>Telecom, Internet &amp; Cable TV</h4>

<p>Providers of telecommunications, internet access, and cable television services can obtain a <a href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/TX/htm/TX.151.htm#151.3186" target="_blank">refund of the state sales and use taxes paid</a> on tangible personal property use or consumed in transmitting, routing, or distributing those services.</p>

<h4>Film, Video &amp; Audio Production Companies &amp; Broadcasting Companies</h4>

<p>A production company may claim a <a href="http://gov.texas.gov/film/incentives/sales_tax_exemptions/" target="_blank">sales or use tax exemption</a> on items or services necessary and essential and used or consumed during the production of a motion picture, commercial, television project, corporate film, infomercial, or video game. These rules apply only to projects intended for commercial distribution, broadcast, or some other exhibition.</p>

<p>Exempt items include tangible personal property that becomes a component part of the qualifying motion picture, video or audio recording, or broadcast; cameras; film; film developing chemicals; lights; props; sets; teleprompters; microphones; digital equipment; special effects equipment and supplies; audio or video routing switchers located in a studio; certain services; and certain other equipment and tangible personal property that are necessary and essential to and used directly in the production.</p>

<p>Non-exempt items include office equipment or supplies; maintenance or janitorial equipment or supplies; machinery, equipment, and supplies used in sales or transportation activities; machinery, equipment, or supplies used in distribution activities, unless otherwise exempted; taxable items used incidentally in a qualifying production or broadcast; telecommunications equipment and services; transmission equipment; security services; motor vehicle parking services; and food and beverages.</p>

<p>Production companies can also obtain <a href="http://gov.texas.gov/film/production/laws_hotel_tax" target="_blank">hotel occupancy tax exemptions</a> (state and local occupancy taxes can be waived after the 30<sup>th</sup> day for stays longer than 30 consecutive days) and tax refunds or exemptions for <a href="http://gov.texas.gov/film/production/laws_fuel_tax" target="_blank">fuels used off road</a>.</p>
